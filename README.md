# ☁️ Personalized Cloud Log Risk Categorizer using AWS CloudTrail

A Python-based tool that analyzes AWS CloudTrail logs and categorizes cloud events into **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** risk levels using custom logic.  
This project is designed for **students, researchers, and cloud security learners** who want actionable insights from AWS logs without needing complex infrastructure setups.

## 📌 Problem Statement

In cloud environments like AWS, thousands of log entries are generated daily through CloudTrail.  
Due to the sheer volume and complexity, **critical security events often go unnoticed**.  

This tool simplifies cloud log analysis by:
- Parsing AWS CloudTrail logs automatically.
- Identifying and classifying potential risks.
- Providing better visibility into user activity and anomalies.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Automate log inspection and categorization to reduce manual analysis time.  
- Enhance **cloud security visibility** by detecting high-risk or unusual operations.  
- Enable **customizable risk rules** to adapt to different security policies.  
- Present results in a **structured and readable format** for security reporting.
